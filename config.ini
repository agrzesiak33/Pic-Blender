# Stock : Images are all of the same scene and the blending is proportional to the number of pictures in the folder
#   - Doesn't need any parameters below
#   - Can accept [main widths] if variable main widths is true
# Selective Stock : Images are of the same scene but the locations in the main widths in the blended image are nonstandard
#   - Needs [main location]
#   - Can accept [main widths] if variable widths is true
# Panorama : Images are all different pieces of the puzzle.  Each image will will have a start and end main index.
#            The final image size is not editable since the blending will be done dependant on the images and indexes.
#            The alignment indexes need to be something that overlaps in each picture
#   - Needs [main start index], [main end index], [left alignment], and [right alignment]


# For the first picture 'start' will put the main width at the beginning
# For the last picture 'end' will put the main width at the end
